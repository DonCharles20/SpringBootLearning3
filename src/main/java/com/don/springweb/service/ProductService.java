    /* =Arrays.asList vs =new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList)
     * Arrays.asList is a static method that returns a fixed-size list backed by the specified array.
     * The list is fixed-size because it is backed by the original array, and any changes to the list will be reflected in the array.
     * The list returned by Arrays.asList is a view of the original array, so it does not support operations that modify the list size.
     * The list returned by Arrays.asList is a List, not an ArrayList, so it does not support operations like add or remove.
     * The list returned by Arrays.asList is a read-only list, so it cannot be modified.
     * 
     * new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList) creates a new ArrayList object that contains the elements of the specified array.
     * The new ArrayList object is a separate object from the original array, so changes to the list will not be reflected in the array.
     * The new ArrayList object is mutable, so it supports operations like add and remove.
     * The new ArrayList object is an ArrayList, so it supports all the operations provided by the ArrayList class.
     * The new ArrayList object is not a view of the original array, so changes to the list will not affect the original array.

    /*What is Stream Api and how does it work here:
     * Stream API is used to process collections of objects. 
     * A stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods 
     * which can be pipelined to produce the desired result.
     * The features of Java stream are:
     * A stream is not a data structure instead it takes input from the Collections, Arrays or I/O channels.
     * Streams donâ€™t change the original data structure, they only provide the result as per the pipelined methods.
     * Each intermediate operation is lazily executed and returns a stream as a result, hence various intermediate operations can be pipelined.
     * Stream is used to compute the result and it does not modify the data structure.
     * Stream API makes the code more readable and maintainable.
     * Stream API is very useful for collection objects.
     * 
     * Here in the Below code we are using the Stream API to filter the product by Id
     * The List of products is converted to a stream 
     * and then we are using the filter method to filter the product by Id which is passed as a parameter
     * of the predicate function using lambda expression
     * and then we are using the findFirst method to get the first product from the filtered list
     * (Chance of getting multiple products is not there)
     * and then we are using the get method to get the product from the Optional object
     *

        * what is an optional object?
        * it is a container object that may or may not contain a non-null value
        * if a value is present, you can call get() to get the value
