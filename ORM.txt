What is ORM?
ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping. It is a programming technique that maps the object to the data stored in the database. 
It is a way to interact with the database using an object-oriented programming language.
ORM allows developers to work with objects instead of writing SQL queries to interact with the database.
It provides a layer of abstraction between the application code and the database, making it easier to work with databases in an object-oriented way.
ORM frameworks like Hibernate, Entity Framework, and Django ORM are popular examples of ORM tools used in various programming languages.

what is Dbms?
DBMS stands for Database Management System. It is a software system that allows users to interact with databases.
DBMS provides an interface to define, create, retrieve, update, and delete data in a database.
It manages the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data in a database.
DBMS provides features like data security, data integrity, concurrency control, and data recovery.
Popular examples of DBMS include MySQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.
*When using a Dbms in spring boot it will ask for the database url and Driver*
*Configure this in the application.properties file.*

What is JPA?
JPA stands for Java Persistence API. 
It is a Java specification for managing relational data in Java applications.
JPA provides a set of interfaces and annotations that allow developers to map Java objects to database tables and perform CRUD operations on them.
JPA is part of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform and is commonly used with ORM frameworks like Hibernate to simplify database interactions in Java applications.
JPA supports various features such as entity mapping, relationships between entities, and query language for database operations.
JPA implementations like Hibernate, EclipseLink, and OpenJPA provide the underlying functionality to work with databases using JPA.

What is Spring Data JPA?
Spring Data JPA is a part of the Spring Data project that makes it easier to work with JPA in Spring applications.
It provides a set of abstractions and utilities to simplify the development of data access layers in Spring applications.
Spring Data JPA reduces the boilerplate code required to interact with the database by providing repository interfaces that define common CRUD operations.
Developers can create custom repository interfaces that extend these interfaces to define additional query methods specific to their application requirements.
Spring Data JPA also supports query methods, derived queries, and pagination to make it easier to work with JPA entities in Spring applications.

What is H2 Database?
H2 Database is an open-source, in-memory, and embedded relational database written in Java.
It is lightweight, fast, and easy to use, making it a popular choice for testing and development purposes.
H2 Database can be run in embedded mode within an application or as a standalone server.
It supports standard SQL syntax and provides features like transactions, indexes, and stored procedures.
H2 Database can be easily integrated with Java applications using JDBC or JPA, making it a versatile choice for database development in Java applications.
